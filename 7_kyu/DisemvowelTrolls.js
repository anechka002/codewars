// DESCRIPTION:
// Trolls are attacking your comment section!

// A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

// Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

// For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

// Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

// SOLUTION:

function disemvowel(str) {
  const regExp = /\a|A|E|e|I|i|O|o|U|u/g
  return str.replace(regExp, '')
}
// console.log(disemvowel("This website is for losers LOL!"))
// console.log(disemvowel("No offense but,\nYour writing is among the worst I've ever read"))
// console.log(disemvowel("What are you, a communist?"))
