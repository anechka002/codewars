// Description:
// You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

// Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

// For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

// Solution:

function updateLight(current) {
  return current === 'green' ? 'yellow' : current === 'yellow' ? 'red' : 'green';
}

console.log(updateLight('red'))
